# imageClassification

In order to deploy this app.

You first need to run project.py. It will then load the dataset into a folder called dataset. It will then train a model for you and will save it to your directory.

This is important because you need the model in order to run the app.py

Then run the app.py and it should work. You just need to load an image in these specific categories (Airplane, Automobile, Bird, Cat, Deer, Dog, Frog, Horse, Ship, Truck)

It will display the image that you loaded, and the name that it is associated with.
